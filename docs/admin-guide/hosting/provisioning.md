# Provision Resources

Here is a general guide for provisioning a VM using a cloud provider:

## Instructions

### Step 1. Choose a Hosting Provider
Select one of the [hosting providers](../installation/hosting.md) based on your budget, region, and preference.

### Step 2. Create Account and Log In
Create an account and log in to the providerâ€™s console.

### Step 3. Select a Virtual Machine Instance Type
Choose an instance type or plan that meets the hardware requirements specified above.

### Step 4. Configure the VM
- **Operating System:** Choose a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04 LTS).
- **Region:** Select a data center region close to your users.
- **Storage:** Allocate at least 50 GB of SSD storage.

### Step 5. Networking
Configure security groups or firewalls to allow inbound connections on necessary ports (e.g., 80, 443, 3306, 8080).

### Step 6. Launch the Virtual Machine
Follow the provider's instructions to launch the VM. Take note of the VM's public IP address and SSH access details. 

### Step 7. Access the Virtual Machine
Use SSH to connect to your VM.  

```bash
ssh username@your_vm_ip_address
```

     You can usually add your public key to the hosting provider configuration for passwordless 
     access to the server. If you did not configure a public key then you will likely be prompted for a password.

### Step 8. Post-Deployment Configuration
Update system packages and install necessary dependencies as outlined in the installation guide.
    ```shell
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    sudo reboot    
    ```

## Conclusion

Once your virtual machine is provisioned, you are ready to install dependencies, configure basic settings, and deploy 
the application. This guide provides a starting point for setting up the infrastructure needed to host the application effectively.
